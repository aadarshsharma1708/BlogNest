## ü§ù Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
* **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **Yarn**
* **Appwrite Instance:** You need a running Appwrite instance (local Docker setup or a hosted solution). Refer to the [Appwrite Documentation](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) for installation instructions.

### Appwrite Backend Setup

1.  **Access Appwrite Console:**
    * If running locally, navigate to `http://localhost/` in your browser.
    * Log in or create a new account.
2.  **Create a New Project:**
    * From the dashboard, click "Create project" and give it a name (e.g., `BlogNest`).
    * **Copy your Project ID** from the project settings; you'll need this for your frontend.
3.  **Setup Database:**
    * Go to **Databases** on the left sidebar.
    * Click "Create database" (e.g., `blogNestDB`).
    * **Copy your Database ID.**
4.  **Create Collections:**
    * Inside your `blogNestDB` (or whatever you named it), click "Create collection".
    * **Create a `posts` collection:**
        * **Collection ID:** Copy this ID.
        * **Attributes:** Add the following attributes with appropriate types and required settings:
            * `title` (String, Required)
            * `slug` (String, Required) - Must be unique
            * `content` (String, Required)
            * `featuredImage` (String, Required) - This will store the File ID from Appwrite Storage
            * `status` (String, Required) - e.g., 'active', 'inactive'
            * `userId` (String, Required) - Stores the ID of the user who created the post
            * `authorName` (String, Required) - Stores the name or email of the author for display
        * **Permissions:** Set **Create** and **Update** permissions for `role:member` (so only logged-in users can create/update posts). Set **Read** permission for `role:any` (so anyone can read posts).
5.  **Setup Storage:**
    * Go to **Storage** on the left sidebar.
    * Click "Create bucket" (e.g., `post_images`).
    * **Copy your Bucket ID.**
    * **Permissions:** Set **Create** permission for `role:member` (to allow authenticated users to upload images). Set **Read** permission for `role:any` (so featured images can be displayed publicly).

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPO_LINK]
    cd BlogNest
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Create Environment Variables:**
    * In the root of your project, create a new file named `.env`.
    * Add the following variables, replacing the placeholder values with your actual Appwrite credentials:

    ```env
    VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=[YOUR_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT]
    VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID]
    VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=[YOUR_DATABASE_ID]
    VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=[YOUR_COLLECTION_ID_FOR_POSTS]
    VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=[YOUR_BUCKET_ID_FOR_IMAGES]
    ```
    * **Note:** For local development with Appwrite Docker, `VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT` is typically `http://localhost/v1`.

4.  **Configure Appwrite SDK in your project:**
    * Ensure your `appwrite/config.js` (or similar file where you initialize Appwrite services) uses these environment variables. It should look something like this:

    ```javascript
    // src/appwrite/config.js
    import { Client, Databases, Storage, Query, ID, Account } from 'appwrite';

    const client = new Client()
        .setEndpoint(String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT))
        .setProject(String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID));

    const account = new Account(client);
    const databases = new Databases(client);
    const storage = new Storage(client);

    const appwriteService = {
        client,
        account,
        databases,
        storage,
        // ... other methods like createPost, updatePost, etc.
        // Make sure databaseId, collectionId, bucketId are used from environment variables
        // e.g., process.env.VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID
    };

    export default appwriteService;
    ```
    * **Important:** Vite uses `import.meta.env` for environment variables, not `process.env`. Make sure your `appwrite/config.js` (or equivalent) reflects this if you are using Vite.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the frontend development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port indicated by your console).
